# tran_scraper

Linguistics project to analyze question type & frequency using a combination of BASH and VIM scripts. Scrapes a web page, removes gunky text, then calculates question-type frequency based on human analysis of transcript. 

Additional functionality could include:

- Passing URLs as arguments to the script, so that any other transcripts located on web pages may be scraped and analyzed.

- Implement lexical analysis to more efficiently compute what question-type a specific question is.

- Anything else you can think of...
